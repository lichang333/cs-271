TITLE Programming Assignment #4 Accumulator (assn4.asm)

; Author: Alec Merdler
; Description:
; Write a program to calculate composite numbers. First, the user is instructed to enter the number of composites to be displayed,
; and is prompted to enter an integer in the range [1 .. 400]. The user enters a number, n, and the program verifies that 1 <= n <= 400.
; If n is out of range, the user is re- prompted until s/he enters a value in the specified range. The program then calculates and
; displays all of the composite numbers up to and including the nth composite. The results should be displayed 10 composites per line
; with at least 3 spaces between the numbers.
